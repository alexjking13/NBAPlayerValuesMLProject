# NBAPlayerValuesMLProject
Creating values for an NBA player's value to their team using Machine Learning algorithms
Use dataset from basketball-reference containing player's total statistics as well as advanced stats for their careers dating back to 1948. 

I focused on the seasons in the "recent" era of NBA basketball. (1975 and on)
There are not consistent statistics before this era and often some are innacurate. 

I used various ML algorithms and techniques until I settled on KNN to cluster the best players together. I then focused on this cluster to break apart the true best seasons anyone has had, and can calculate their importance to their team from this value.
